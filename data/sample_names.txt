# Sample Names File
# This file shows the expected format for names.pkl
# Replace with actual names when training the system

# Example format:
# ["John Doe", "John Doe", "John Doe", ..., "Jane Smith", "Jane Smith", ...]
# Each name should appear 100 times (one for each captured face image)

# Note: This is just a template. The actual names.pkl file will be created
# when you run add_faces.py and will contain binary data.
